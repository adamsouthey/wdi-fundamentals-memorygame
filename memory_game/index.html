	<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p> Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	
	<h2>What Makes The Memory Card Game Fun</h2>
		<p>This game is a great family card game. You can play it with a regular pack of cards, or with picture cards that your child might like.
		Younger players are often able to compete with older players because they can be very good at memory-based games.</p>
